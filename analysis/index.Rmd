This is the website for demonstrating how to use the [`scclusteval`](https://github.com/crazyhottommy/scclusteval) R package. This R package
works with the output from the [Snakemake workflow](https://github.com/crazyhottommy/pyflow_seuratv3_parameter)

Readers can download the datasets at https://osf.io/rfbcg/ and 
follow the analysis in the Rmarkdown files.

You can find the analysis for the mixology dataset and the 5k pbmc dataset in
the `Content` drop list. We also run the [Snakemake workflow](https://github.com/crazyhottommy/pyflow_seuratv3_parameter) for a neuron dataset
from Allen Brain Institute and you can find the data in the [osf.io](https://osf.io/rfbcg/) link above.

* The 5k pbmc scRNAseq dataset was downloaded from 10x website and made into a `Seruat` object.

* The Seurat rds file for the 5- cancer cell line mixology dataset is dowloaded from https://github.com/LuyiTian/sc_mixology

* The Seurat rds file for the neuron dataset is downloaded from https://satijalab.org/signac/articles/mouse_brain_vignette.html

>You can download the raw data for this experiment from the Allen Institute [website](http://celltypes.brain-map.org/api/v2/well_known_file_download/694413985), and view the code used to construct this object on [GitHub](https://github.com/satijalab/Integration2019/blob/master/preprocessing_scripts/allen_brain.R). Alternatively, you can download the pre-processed Seurat object [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kqsy9tvsklbu7c4/allen_brain.rds?dl=0).

Readers can follow the examples of the mixology and pbmc dataset and explore the 
neuron dataset yourself. Have fun!
